# Global-Weather-APP

This application was created with the purpose of giving the global traveler access to real time and future forecasts. Weather is an essential piece of the equation, when planning a trip. This app provides the critical information the user needs,  to make those highly important decisions. Like; do I pack shorts and tees, or jeans and an umbrella!?!
